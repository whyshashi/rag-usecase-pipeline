    "query": "what do you make of risk factors in the document ?",
    "answer": "Based on the provided documents, risk factors are presented as potential adverse events or conditions that could negatively impact Prudential's financial situation, business operations, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. These risks are multifaceted and can be broadly categorized as follows:\n\n**1. Market and Economic Risks:**\n*   **Market Fluctuations and General Economic Conditions:** Prudential's businesses are inherently exposed to changes in market conditions and the broader economy.\n*   **Macroeconomic Uncertainty:** Fluctuations or negative trends in global and national macroeconomic conditions and investment climates can significantly affect profitability.\n*   **Inflationary Environment:** Rising energy and commodity prices, exacerbated by geopolitical events (e.g., Russia-Ukraine conflict) and supply chain issues, contribute to inflation.\n*   **Interest Rate Hikes:** Central banks tightening financial conditions and increasing interest rates can negatively impact the valuation of fixed income assets and future profits due to higher discount rates.\n*   **Exchange Rate Weakness:** Rising rates in developed economies can weaken emerging market currencies, adversely affecting consolidated financial statements when translated into the reporting currency (US dollars).\n*   **Government and Central Bank Actions:** The nature and extent of responses to inflation by governments and central banks introduce uncertainty.\n*   **COVID-19 Policy Changes:** The relaxation of zero-tolerance COVID-19 policies and border reopenings in China create market uncertainties.\n*   **Transition to a Lower Carbon Economy:** The timing and speed of this transition are uncertain and can lead to fluctuations in asset valuations, reduced liquidity (especially for carbon-intensive sectors), and impact inflation levels.\n*   **Financial Market Upheavals:** Disruptions in financial markets can affect economic activity, employment, and customer behavior.\n\n**2. Insurance and Customer-Related Risks:**\n*   **Elevated Incidence of Claims, Frauds, Lapses, or Surrenders:** Financial market upheavals can lead to an increase in these events.\n*   **Policyholder Behavior:** Customers may defer or stop paying premiums or reduce deposits into retirement plans due to uncertainty over livelihoods, high cost of living, and affordability challenges.\n*   **Demand for Insurance Products:** Affordability issues can negatively impact the demand for insurance products.\n*   **Adverse Experience Relative to Assumptions:** Deviations from expected mortality and morbidity levels, policy surrenders, guarantee feature take-up rates, investment performance, administrative costs, and new business acquisition expenses can affect profitability.\n*   **Persistency and Morbidity Experience:** COVID-19 related restrictions can have adverse impacts on these factors.\n*   **Medical Inflation Risk:** Prudential's medical insurance businesses are particularly exposed to rising medical costs.\n*   **Medical Reimbursement Downgrade Experience:** This can negatively impact profitability following any re-pricing of products.\n\n**3. Operational and Regulatory Risks:**\n*   **Fraud Risks:** The Group consults with forensic professionals to identify fraud risks based on discussions of its circumstances.\n*   **Regulatory Capital Solvency Margins:** Movements in interest rates can impact these margins.\n*   **Regulatory Risk:** Meeting regulatory definitions and expectations, especially concerning affordability and protection of vulnerable customers, presents a risk.\n*   **Increased Regulatory and Societal Expectations:** These can influence the ability to re-price products.\n*   **Operational and Resource Capacity:** The ability to re-price products is dependent on having sufficient operational and resource capacity.\n\n**4. Health and Pandemic Risks:**\n*   **Epidemics, Pandemics, and Other Health Events:** These can lead to a large number of deaths or additional sickness claims, as well as increased medical claim costs.\n*   **Effectiveness of External Parties:** The success of governmental and non-governmental organizations in combating disease spread, as well as the availability and rollout of treatments and vaccines, can significantly impact claims experience.\n*   **COVID-19:** Specific risks related to COVID-19 are mentioned as being included in risk factor 1.3.\n\nIn essence, risk factors for Prudential are identified as a broad spectrum of internal and external forces that can disrupt its operations, diminish its financial standing, and hinder its future growth. These risks are often interconnected, with economic instability potentially leading to changes in customer behavior, which in turn can affect insurance claims and profitability."

    "query": "How did 2021 IFRS profit compare to 2020?",
    "answer": "Based on the provided documents, here's how the 2021 IFRS profit compares to 2020:\n\n*   **Document 1** provides a breakdown of profit for the year. For 2021, the \"Loss for the year\" is **(4,043)**. For 2020, the \"Loss for the year\" is **(581)**. This indicates a significant increase in losses from 2020 to 2021.\n\n*   **Document 3** also shows a \"Loss for the year\" of **(5,027)** for 2021, which is attributable to equity holders of the Company as **(4,234)**. This document does not provide 2020 figures for comparison.\n\n*   **Document 2** presents profit figures for 2021, but it does not provide comparative data for 2020.\n\nTherefore, comparing the available information:\n\nThe **loss for the year in 2021 was (4,043)** (from Document 1), which is a worse result than the **loss for the year in 2020 of (581)** (from Document 1)."

    "query": "How does Prudential manage market risk?",
    "answer": "Prudential manages market risk through a multi-faceted approach that involves a defined policy, risk appetite statements, and active management committees. The Group accepts market risk where it arises from profit-generating insurance activities, provided it's part of a balanced income portfolio and compatible with a robust solvency position.\n\nKey management and mitigation strategies include:\n\n*   **Group Market Risk Policy:** This policy outlines the framework for managing market risks.\n*   **Risk Appetite Statements, Limits, and Triggers:** These define the acceptable level of market risk and establish thresholds for action.\n*   **Capital and Asset Liability Management Committees:** These committees oversee and guide the management of assets and liabilities to mitigate market risks.\n*   **Asset and Liability Management (ALM) Activities:** This includes:\n    *   **Interest Rate Risk Management:** Prudential aims to tightly match assets and liabilities for exposures where hedging instruments are available. Interest rate risk is accepted when it cannot be hedged, provided it stems from profitable products and aligns with a balanced risk exposure and solvency position. Management actions like changes in asset allocation, bonus revisions, repricing, and reinsurance are employed.\n*   **Group Investment Committee and Group Investment Policy:** These bodies guide investment strategies to manage market risks.\n*   **Hedging using Derivatives:** Prudential utilizes derivatives, such as currency forwards, to hedge against market exposures.\n*   **Monitoring and Oversight:** Market risks are continuously monitored through regular reporting of management information and regular deep dive assessments.\n*   **Group Critical Incident Procedure (GCIP):** This procedure defines governance for critical incidents, including significant market events, and can involve convening a Critical Incident Group (CIG) to oversee and direct activities.\n\nPrudential acknowledges that market risks, such as fluctuations in equity prices, interest rates, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, and property prices, can impact investment values. While direct exposure to inflation is modest, it can arise through increased medical claims, which the business manages by repricing products. The company also recognizes that residual asset/liability mismatch risk, particularly in markets with less developed bond markets or longer liability durations, cannot be eliminated but can be managed. This mismatch can adversely affect reported profit and solvency if interest rates remain lower than those used for premium and claim calculations. Furthermore, profits from with-profits products, which are linked to investment returns versus guaranteed rates, can be reduced in sustained low-interest-rate environments."
