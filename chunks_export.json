This purpose is well aligned with the long-term public policy priorities in our chosen markets in Asia and Africa: providing products and services to help to close health, protection and savings gaps where social safety nets vary considerably; helping to respond to long-term demographic changes; and supporting a just and inclusive transition in emerging markets in the face of climate change.",

Our Vietnam business continued to outperform the market in 2022, delivering a strong APE growth of 26 per cent10 compared with 2021, stronger than the industry APE growth of 8 per cent29, underpinned by double-digit growth rates in both bank and agency channels.\n\nIn Vietnam, we continued to provide customer segment-led propositions by offering affordable protection solutions to the mass market segment alongside providing savings, education and health and protection plans to the middle-income segment, and serving the investment needs of affluent customers. To address the market’s need for affordable protection solutions, we have launched System and Organ Function Insurance (SOFI), which provides simple to understand health coverage based on the severity of symptoms and organ function of customers. We also have launched PRU-Easy365 offering comprehensive protection benefits against accidental risk and three common critical illnesses for customers. More than 2,100 and 31,100 SOFI and PRU-Easy365 policies respectively have been sold since launch, increasing our penetration into the younger segment of the population.\n\nIn Taiwan, APE sales grew 35 per cent10 during 2022 driven by strong growth in both bancassurance and brokerage channels, outperforming the market which reported a contraction of (11) per cent during 2022 compared with 2021. New business profit rose strongly driven by the increase in sales and favourable product mix changes.\n\nIn Africa, despite headwinds from inflation and Covid-19, APE sales grew by 19 per cent10 year-on-year, with a broad-based performance across all channels, new business profit margin comparable with the prior year.",

As a result, over 50 per cent of new customers were onboarded directly and through partnerships with fintech companies and neobanks, resulting in an existing customer base of circa eight million.\n\nClient excellence During a year when market headwinds resulted in challenging outcomes for both the asset management industry and its clients, Eastspring maintained its client-centric approach and frequently engaged internal and external clients to better understand their challenges and investment needs. In doing so, it could best meet client expectations and provide tailored solutions.\n\nCPFMC has deep cooperative relationships with over 40 local research institutes and provides Qualified Foreign Institutional Investors (QFII) with professional investment advisory services. Since 2021, it has been building out its pension target funds, which attracted steady net subscriptions from retail investors.\n\nEastspring continued to strengthen its relationship with the Prudential Group’s life insurance and corporate asset owners, including launching customised strategies for local markets.\n\nAcross its institutional business, Eastspring continued winning mandates, and top-ups, from some of the largest pension and sovereign wealth funds. Notably, the firm has seen good success in its international markets of the Americas, Europe, and Taiwan and Malaysia’s Islamic business.\n\n30\n\nprudentialplc.com\n\nGroup overview\n\nGovernance\n\nDirectors’ remuneration report\n\nFinancial statements\n\nEuropean Embedded Value (EEV) basis results\n\nAdditional information\n\nPrudential plc Annual Report 2022\n\nStrategic report",

Although our new business profit generation5 of $2.2 billion was lower, this largely reflected the impact of economic effects under our EEV framework, notably in Hong Kong. Our markets outside of Hong Kong delivered combined new business profit growth of 5 per cent4. IFRS profit for the year was also negatively impacted by the increases in interest rates and decreases in equity market values in the year, as further discussed below and in the section headed IFRS basis non-operating items.\n\n2022 saw considerable macroeconomic volatility, characterised in many markets by lower equity index levels, material increases in government bond yields and widening corporate bond spreads. The MSCI Asia excluding Japan equity index fell (24) per cent, the Hang Seng index fell by (15) per cent and the CSI 300 index fell by (22) per cent while the S&P 500 index fell by (19) per cent. Government bond yields in many of our markets ended the year higher with the US 10-year yield increasing by 236 basis points to 3.9 per cent. As well as their impact on IFRS profit for the year, lower associated asset values and consequent impact on fee generating account balances, together with the impact of higher discount rates under our active EEV methodology, contributed to a fall in our embedded value in the year.\n\nThe year also saw the US dollar increase in value relative to many currencies globally, resulting in a translation headwind. As in previous years, we comment on our performance in local currency terms (expressed on a constant exchange rate basis) to show the underlying business trends in periods of currency movement, unless otherwise noted.\n\nGroup EEV operating profit increased by 15 per cent4 to $3,952 million largely due to 13 per cent4 growth in operating returns from the long-term business. This reflects the higher expected return from underlying business growth and higher interest rates, partially offset by lower new business profit and a lower benefit from assumption changes than was seen in the prior year. Operating return on embedded value8 was 9 per cent compared with 8 per cent in 2021.

APE sales were broadly balanced between Greater China6 and South-east7 Asia across our four main product groups, with an emphasis on health and protection, and across distribution channels with our bancassurance channel providing notable resilience in periods of disruption for our agency salesforce. Given the active basis of our EEV methodology, rising interest rates led to both higher risk discount rates and higher assumed fund earned rates being applied.

IFRS 17 costs are expected to remain elevated until the standard is fully implemented in 2023.\n\nEastspring’s adjusted operating profit of $260 million was down (13) per cent4 compared with the prior year, reflecting a decline in the average funds under management or advice and losses on shareholder investments including seed capital in its retail funds, compared with gains in 2021. Operating income before gains and losses on shareholder investments and performance related fees was (4) per cent4 lower, reflecting a (5) per cent4 decline in average funds under management or advice.

In the Chinese Mainland, various policy and regulatory developments relevant to the provision of financial services are in progress, as is the implementation of the market’s data governance pillars. Regulatory focus on the financial services industry remains broad and often concurrent, and includes areas such as customer conduct and protection, information security and data privacy and residency, third-party management, systemic risk regulation, corporate governance and senior management accountability. Climate and sustainability-related regulatory developments continue to develop at pace, both globally and in Asia.\n\n50\n\nprudentialplc.com",

These actions include, but are not limited to, rebalancing investment portfolios, increased use of reinsurance, repricing of in-force benefits and changes to the mix of new business being sold. In addition, the Group conducts an annual reverse stress test which gives the Directors an understanding of the maximum resilience of the Group to extremely severe adverse scenarios.

The revised remit of the GRC is also anticipated to include the consideration of climate-related issues when reviewing and guiding overall strategy, major plans of action, risk management policies, annual budgets and business plans. To support the GRC in executing its duties, the Group’s policies and processes supporting significant decisions and transactions have been updated to systematically include consideration of how the matter requiring approval supports and/or impacts the Group’s ESG strategy, including setting and overseeing major capital expenditures, acquisitions, and divestitures.\n\n> The RSWG retained responsibility for reviewing the Group ESG Report in totality and making recommendations to the Group Audit Committee (GAC) and the Board.\n\n> The GAC considered the Group ESG report within its broader review and recommendation of the full Annual Report and Accounts to the Board.",

For example, in Malaysia Pulse offers free services such as health assessments, symptom checkers, incentivised health challenges and relevant news articles related to health. In addition, we offer free telemedicine services to all Malaysian Pulse users through our partner, DocOnCall. In 2022, we launched the Medical Booster function, which rewards customers with a non-claim benefit up to $220/RM1,000 for taking action to stay healthy. This reinforces awareness around preventive care, by allowing customers to claim for services such as health screenings, vaccinations, diagnostic tests, and health subscription programmes on Pulse.",

Product feasibility assessment Customer research is first conducted to truly understand customer needs, concerns and pain points on financial security and resilience for different life-stages of various customer segments.

We have identified that these metrics are appropriate for internal use at this stage, despite having limitations surrounding data availability and the level of assumptions underlying the methodologies. As of late 2022, our internal reporting has been enhanced to include the ITR as an indicator of the level of temperature alignment of our investment portfolio, and C-VAR as an indicator of the forward- looking exposure on the investment portfolio’s exposure to physical and transition climate change risks. We continue to develop our internal understanding of these metrics, while giving consideration to disclosing them externally when these shortcomings are appropriately overcome or can be mitigated.\n\nThe NZIA’s members commit to ‘transition their insurance and reinsurance underwriting portfolios to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, consistent with a maximum temperature rise of 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels by 2100, in order to contribute to the implementation of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change’. The current scope of this alliance is property and casualty insurance. This scope excludes Prudential, as a life and health business, which does not underwrite carbon intense activities. Therefore joining the NZIA at this time is not a current priority for us, and we will continue to evaluate its appropriateness moving forward.",

We have identified that these metrics are appropriate for internal use at this stage, despite having limitations surrounding data availability and the level of assumptions underlying the methodologies. As of late 2022, our internal reporting has been enhanced to include the ITR as an indicator of the level of temperature alignment of our investment portfolio, and C-VAR as an indicator of the forward- looking exposure on the investment portfolio’s exposure to physical and transition climate change risks. We continue to develop our internal understanding of these metrics, while giving consideration to disclosing them externally when these shortcomings are appropriately overcome or can be mitigated.\n\nThe NZIA’s members commit to ‘transition their insurance and reinsurance underwriting portfolios to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, consistent with a maximum temperature rise of 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels by 2100, in order to contribute to the implementation of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change’. The current scope of this alliance is property and casualty insurance. This scope excludes Prudential, as a life and health business, which does not underwrite carbon intense activities. Therefore joining the NZIA at this time is not a current priority for us, and we will continue to evaluate its appropriateness moving forward.",

We are starting to see air travel increase, and we anticipate emissions from air travel will increase further in 2023, towards pre-pandemic levels. In 2022, Scope 3 business travel emissions have risen by 173 per cent compared with 2021 but remains 26 per cent lower than for 2020.

The energy consumption associated with our employees working from home has not been captured in our reporting in 2022. We recognise that with the broader adoption of hybrid working, a proportion of our staff will continue to spend part of their week working away from the office, and we therefore need to better understand the emissions associated with this. We have started developing an emissions calculator designed to model Scope 3 emissions associated with staff working from home and we are piloting this in our Singapore life business. The assumptions used in this model are aligned with the framework used by the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA) and aligned with the GHG Protocol.\n\nMonitoring our progress We have made considerable effort to engage with our businesses on the importance of reporting throughout 2022. There has been a continued focus on improving our data collection programme, and we have seen data quality improve, with greater completeness and fewer accruals. Due to the pandemic restrictions, we placed site- based energy assessments on hold from 2021, limiting our access to relevant data.

We are starting to see air travel increase, and we anticipate emissions from air travel will increase further in 2023, towards pre-pandemic levels. In 2022, Scope 3 business travel emissions have risen by 173 per cent compared with 2021 but remains 26 per cent lower than for 2020.

The energy consumption associated with our employees working from home has not been captured in our reporting in 2022. We recognise that with the broader adoption of hybrid working, a proportion of our staff will continue to spend part of their week working away from the office, and we therefore need to better understand the emissions associated with this. We have started developing an emissions calculator designed to model Scope 3 emissions associated with staff working from home and we are piloting this in our Singapore life business. The assumptions used in this model are aligned with the framework used by the Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs (DEFRA) and aligned with the GHG Protocol.\n\nMonitoring our progress We have made considerable effort to engage with our businesses on the importance of reporting throughout 2022. There has been a continued focus on improving our data collection programme, and we have seen data quality improve, with greater completeness and fewer accruals. Due to the pandemic restrictions, we placed site- based energy assessments on hold from 2021, limiting our access to relevant data.

We maintain a culture where diversity is celebrated, and inclusion assured for our people, customers and partners.\n\nOur Global Diversity & Inclusion (D&I) Council continues to define our global D&I strategy and action plan, while driving D&I initiatives across our businesses. The Council provides updates to the Board twice a year and the Responsibility & Sustainability Working Group (RSWG) receives quarterly D&I updates. In 2022, we onboarded new members to the Council to focus on inclusion of neurodiversity, disability, culture and religion. The Council continues to be guided by its Charter and adhere to the principles of empowering our employees, fostering transparency and creating communities. Building on the local endorsement of the United Nations Women’s Empowerment Principles in a number of our markets in 2021, our Group Chief Executive signed a Group-wide support statement for them in 2022.\n\nIn 2022, we continued our focus on increasing inclusion awareness, complementing the work with our leadership outlined in the section on ‘Leadership’. One of the key initiatives was the implementation of our Global Inclusion e-learning courses, which aim to build awareness, nurture inclusion and promote inclusive leadership mindsets and behaviours. The Global Inclusion e-learning was completed by approximately 86 per cent of the workforce in 2022, which sets the stage for our work to further deepen belonging in 2023.",

We address diverse needs and profiles with inclusive, rewarding and innovative propositions such as our We DO Family campaign, as set out in ‘Making health and financial security accessible’ section. The campaign extended to our employees, with a storytelling campaign where over 100 employee stories were shared internally, demonstrating the diversity of their families. We also embed D&I principles in our Third Party Supply and Outsourcing Policy, with the requirement to review our suppliers’ approach to diversity.\n\nFollowing the launch of PRUCommunities in 2021, our employee-led networks continued to enhance connections and are key to deepening belonging at Prudential. In 2022, we saw the global launch of various communities including PRU Women Empowered, PRU Young Professionals, Women in Tech, Mental Health First Aiders and the intersectional We DO Wellness, joining the well-established PRUPride. Local businesses have also established their own PRUCommunities to further strengthen connection and collaboration around interests, identities and ideas. In 2022, PRUCommunities articles were viewed by more than 10,000 employees, including nearly 2,800 views on the Community Connections page, and nearly 3,500 views of our We DO Wellness page.\n\nIn 2022, Prudential signed the Neurodiversity in Business Membership Charter as part of our commitment to further strengthen inclusion and deepen belonging in the workplace. This includes challenging and removing both physical and perceived barriers to inclusion, while celebrating neurodiversity and the value of neurodiverse individuals, and providing accommodations where necessary to enable these individuals to perform their roles at Prudential.\n\nA summary of our D&I performance is included below. While our diversity figures have mostly improved year-on-year, we recognise that we have more to do in this area.\n\n> At 31 December 2022, the representation of women on our Board was 31 per cent; following Board changes on 1 January 2023, representation was 38 per cent.\n\n> We have exceeded the recommendation of the Parker Review for the FTSE 250 to have at least one non-white director on the Board by 2024, with six of our 13 directors meeting these criteria. We are one of only five FTSE 100 companies with a non-white Chair. Non-white representation on our Group Executive Committee (GEC) has also improved in 2022, with 63 per cent of members meeting these criteria compared with 20 per cent in previous years, following our restructuring of this body to better reflect the communities we serve.",

My mentor has challenged me beyond my comfort zone and helped me navigate through challenges I never dreamt I could. She has helped me recognise how showing up as my authentic self can help build my confidence, influence leaders, and manage engagement with senior stakeholders more assertively. I am more confident and positive over my work, now more than ever.\n\nFor a new employee like me and with the strong support from my line manager, joining this gig was a great opportunity to meet people and showcase my expertise. Virtual reality was one of the key learnings I had from this gig, a skill which I never thought I would be exposed to. I also learned the value of teamwork and how having a shared goal to make this gig a success is important.",

Should engaged companies fail to indicate progress on meaningful sustainability commitments, further actions are taken. These can include divestment as a last resort, if identified material risks are deemed to sufficiently impact investment conviction, and if any future engagement is likely to fail.\n\nExclusions Prudential has an exclusion policy for certain industries, including controversial weapons, tobacco, and companies that derive more than 30 per cent of their revenue from coal. When considering a Group-wide exclusion, an assessment is made on the expected risk versus return impact of the investment portfolio.\n\nPrudential does consider exceptions, such as for certified green bonds for coal, which can be granted on a case-by-case basis. These bonds must contribute to a transition consistent with (or better than) the Paris Agreement. The portfolio manager must also seek reasonable assurance that funding provided by the green bond is not freeing up additional financial capacity for that issuer, or related companies in the market, that will be used to fund non-sustainable alternatives. Our robust and continuous control processes help to mitigate the implementation complexities which exceptions introduce.\n\nIn 2022, Eastspring identified 22 different players within the palm oil industry (17 plantations and supply-chain companies, four fast- moving consumer goods companies, and RSPO itself) for engagement on sustainable palm agriculture practices. The purpose is to assess and engage, in order to elevate the standards of growing or sourcing, to meet all material aspects of the RSPO and SPOTT index. To conduct its initial assessment, Eastspring developed a set of criteria required to assess all the different players in the palm oil industry. Thus far, Eastspring has reviewed 100 per cent of the companies, and commenced engagement with 95 per cent of the same group. Eastspring will continue these engagements into 2023 and beyond.\n\nPortfolio’s exposure to companies violating the UNGC The UNGC is a voluntary United Nations pact to encourage businesses to adopt sustainable and socially responsible policies, and to report on their implementation. The 10 principles of the UNGC are derived from international agreements on four topics: human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption. Screening for violators of the UNGC is needed to encourage companies to change their conduct and comply with international agreements brought together in the UNGC.",

When considering a Group-wide exclusion, an assessment is made on the expected risk versus return impact of the investment portfolio.\n\nPrudential does consider exceptions, such as for certified green bonds for coal, which can be granted on a case-by-case basis. These bonds must contribute to a transition consistent with (or better than) the Paris Agreement. The portfolio manager must also seek reasonable assurance that funding provided by the green bond is not freeing up additional financial capacity for that issuer, or related companies in the market, that will be used to fund non-sustainable alternatives. Our robust and continuous control processes help to mitigate the implementation complexities which exceptions introduce.\n\nIn 2022, Eastspring identified 22 different players within the palm oil industry (17 plantations and supply-chain companies, four fast- moving consumer goods companies, and RSPO itself) for engagement on sustainable palm agriculture practices. The purpose is to assess and engage, in order to elevate the standards of growing or sourcing, to meet all material aspects of the RSPO and SPOTT index. To conduct its initial assessment, Eastspring developed a set of criteria required to assess all the different players in the palm oil industry. Thus far, Eastspring has reviewed 100 per cent of the companies, and commenced engagement with 95 per cent of the same group. Eastspring will continue these engagements into 2023 and beyond.\n\nPortfolio’s exposure to companies violating the UNGC The UNGC is a voluntary United Nations pact to encourage businesses to adopt sustainable and socially responsible policies, and to report on their implementation. The 10 principles of the UNGC are derived from international agreements on four topics: human rights, labour, environment and anti-corruption. Screening for violators of the UNGC is needed to encourage companies to change their conduct and comply with international agreements brought together in the UNGC.",

Eastspring have identified 14 companies that have failed the UNGC screening (ie, flagged as failure by our third-party data vendor) and will engage them as a result. The majority of these 14 companies are from the mining sector.

In setting our threshold for divestment, we take great care in balancing our stewardship duties in developing markets with our dedication to the low-carbon transition. We firmly believe that the foundation for a truly just and inclusive transition lies in the dedication to work with companies to phase coal out more quickly and effectively, as opposed to strict divestment that diverts necessary financing for the transition. As such, we believe that the 30 per cent revenue threshold appropriately balances this perspective, and are continually monitoring this decision.\n\nIn 2021, we fully divested from equities meeting the policy criteria, which we continue to monitor so as to maintain this divestment position. By the end of 2022, we had substantively completed our commitment to divest from coal bonds meeting the policy criteria: we had divested from 97 per cent of the coal bonds held at 31 March 2021, the date used for our May 2021 commitment. Due to illiquidity in the market, we were unable to fully divest from one remaining holding of $12.1m, which illustrates the degree of challenge in implementing a divestment strategy in our markets. We continue to seek opportunities to divest from the remaining holding and intend to do so as soon as practicable. We also continue to engage with the issuer on other options for us to divest from this holding as we believe we have set our coal policy in a just and inclusive manner.

The aim is to formulate sectoral approaches to inform investment decisions and engagement on climate change.\n\nIn many decarbonisation models, a company in an emerging market (eg Indonesia) is expected to decarbonise at the same rate as a company operating in a developed market (eg Germany). This does not do justice to the local circumstances, such as availability of clean energy in an electric grid. In addition, Prudential faces the challenge of data coverage, which is generally poorer in emerging markets than in developed markets.\n\nThe working group explored a range of sectoral decarbonisation pathways and toolkits, and chose the Transition Pathway Initiative\n\n(TPI) tool. This tool allows the assessment of companies based on an IEA-aligned 1.5°C scenario, a below 2°C scenario, and a national pledges scenario (which combines all global pledges on net zero). To address the data coverage challenge, we are developing an internal tool to complement the TPI tool, which will be made available across the organisation to investment teams within our local businesses.\n\nAdditionally, the working group assessed sectoral engagement questions from leading industry sources. Based on this analysis, the working group focused on developing a list of sector-specific engagement questions for the utilities sector, designed to elicit a higher quality engagement response, and ultimately greater decarbonisation progress.

This complements the fundamental research process of Eastspring’s investment team, in both active equity and fixed income.\n\nEastspring’s central engagement capability helps attract and retain clients by meeting rising stakeholder expectations. The process also ensures alignment with strengthening regulatory expectations, such as those of MAS, who notably urged asset managers to directly address environmental and climate-related risks in its May 2022 policy update.\n\nThroughout this process, the sustainability team integrates research insights – from both Eastspring investment professionals and third-party platforms– to inform its ongoing engagements.\n\nClimate change and decarbonisation Prudential fully supports the urgent need to reduce global carbon emissions to limit climate change, in line with the Paris Agreement. We therefore believe in using our influence to limit the impact of climate change, benefitting our policyholders through reduced impact on their daily lives, and limiting the financial impact on the portfolios we manage for them.\n\nThese efforts focus primarily on ESG themes, initially targeting companies who are not disclosing in line with global initiatives. Currently, the central sustainability team at Eastspring primarily engages on the theme of climate change and decarbonisation, and how portfolio companies can take relevant action. Other thematic engagements include palm oil, and violations of the UNGC.\n\nEastspring currently engages with companies responsible for 65 per cent of our Absolute Carbon Footprint, defined as the absolute GHG emissions associated with an investment portfolio (expressed in tonnes of CO2e). Eastspring utilises third-party data to calculate this footprint of portfolios and securities in scope, and identify the top carbon-emitting companies that correspond to this 65 per cent.\n\nIn planning for engagement, Eastspring seeks to directly communicate with target companies using the process summarised in the diagram above. The written letter and email follow-up process introduces Eastspring and its overall stewardship approach – including its alignment with ICGN principles – before delivering targeted questions.\n\nA process is in place to monitor and report progress to the asset owner (Prudential) and other stakeholders. Continuous engagement allows for incremental improvements and achievement of milestones at portfolio companies to be recognised, as well as escalation and intervention for relevant businesses.

The process also ensures alignment with strengthening regulatory expectations, such as those of MAS, who notably urged asset managers to directly address environmental and climate-related risks in its May 2022 policy update.\n\nThroughout this process, the sustainability team integrates research insights – from both Eastspring investment professionals and third-party platforms– to inform its ongoing engagements.\n\nClimate change and decarbonisation Prudential fully supports the urgent need to reduce global carbon emissions to limit climate change, in line with the Paris Agreement. We therefore believe in using our influence to limit the impact of climate change, benefitting our policyholders through reduced impact on their daily lives, and limiting the financial impact on the portfolios we manage for them.\n\nThese efforts focus primarily on ESG themes, initially targeting companies who are not disclosing in line with global initiatives. Currently, the central sustainability team at Eastspring primarily engages on the theme of climate change and decarbonisation, and how portfolio companies can take relevant action. Other thematic engagements include palm oil, and violations of the UNGC.\n\nEastspring currently engages with companies responsible for 65 per cent of our Absolute Carbon Footprint, defined as the absolute GHG emissions associated with an investment portfolio (expressed in tonnes of CO2e). Eastspring utilises third-party data to calculate this footprint of portfolios and securities in scope, and identify the top carbon-emitting companies that correspond to this 65 per cent.\n\nIn planning for engagement, Eastspring seeks to directly communicate with target companies using the process summarised in the diagram above. The written letter and email follow-up process introduces Eastspring and its overall stewardship approach – including its alignment with ICGN principles – before delivering targeted questions.\n\nA process is in place to monitor and report progress to the asset owner (Prudential) and other stakeholders. Continuous engagement allows for incremental improvements and achievement of milestones at portfolio companies to be recognised, as well as escalation and intervention for relevant businesses. The ‘Eastspring’s engagement on climate change and decarbonisation’ box below provides further detail on the milestones used.",

        "raw_text": "Our new Policy also introduced responsible supplier guidelines which include additional considerations for a supplier’s environmental, social and governance practices in addition to existing supplier qualification requirements tied to their capabilities, competitiveness and assessment of third-party risks. These additional considerations are applied to suppliers that are material to the Group, or those suppliers that operate in industries where base-skilled labour is often employed, including cleaning services, catering, security services and low-cost manufacturing, or in geographies affected by conflicts, countries with a weak rule of law and countries with a high number of migrant workers.\n\nIn 2022 we materially completed the Group-wide deployment of our third-party risk assessment platform, Coupa Risk Assess, to provide a single system for the performance of supplier risk assessment and due diligence activities. This system continues to strengthen our visibility of third-party risks such as information and technology security concerns, data privacy, anti-bribery and corruption and business continuity and resiliency risks. Through this system we also issue due diligence questionnaires aligned to the principles of the responsible supplier guidelines, which are covered further below. To date, Coupa Risk Assess has facilitated the assessment of 1,900 suppliers across the Group which represents close to 20 per cent of all our suppliers across the Group. As the deployment of this tool was materially completed within 2022, we expect to see coverage increase in the coming years as the platform continues to be embedded and operationalised across our businesses, and as we refresh our due diligence with suppliers on a periodic basis in line with our policies and procedures.\n\n140\n\nprudentialplc.com\n\nSupply chain onboarding due diligence process Our businesses conduct due diligence before engaging with and ultimately selecting a new supplier. We perform regular due diligence, review meetings and audits where required, and our policies and procedures are supported by regular employee training exercises.

We also require our employees to confirm compliance with the Code of Business Conduct.\n\nSupply chain onboarding",

The programme is also supported by regular communications containing useful resources.\n\nThe Speak Out programme is overseen by the Group Audit Committee, and local business audit committees through quarterly and annual reporting. Operational oversight is exercised by the Group Chief Security Officer through the Investigations Advisory Committee which reports to the Group Chief Risk & Compliance Officer who chairs the Investigations Risk Committee. These committees have access to analysis of case trends, root cause, and an annual assessment of the effectiveness of the Speak Out programme which is benchmarked externally. Any material issues are reported to the Board.\n\nThe annual external benchmark is independently conducted by an external third party and an overall score is applied based on an aggregate of the three scored elements: Governance (which considers the structure and oversight of the programme), Engagement (how well staff are trained and engaged), and Operations (practical effectiveness of the programme). The 2022 overall score for Speak Out is 86 per cent, an improvement of five percentage points from 2021, and higher than industry benchmark of 70 per cent. Scores for the three elements are: Governance: 95 per cent; Engagement: 69 per cent; Operations: 92 per cent.",

Arijit Basu and Claudia Suessmuth Dyckerhoff were appointed to the RSWG on joining the Board, with Jeremy Anderson stepping down from it on 31 March 2023 after the publication of the ESG Report, in light of his appointment as Senior Independent Director from the AGM in May 2023.\n\n179\n\nOur leadership",

All audit and risk committees of the Material Subsidiaries, as well as a number of other subsidiaries’ committees, are chaired by an independent board member.

The deferred part of the bonus is subject to malus and clawback in accordance with the malus and clawback policies, but no further performance conditions. The estimated value of the 2022 PLTIP awards vesting for all Executive Directors has been calculated based on the average share price over the last three months of 2022 (£9.62/US$11.89) and includes the accumulated dividends delivered in the form of shares. The Committee’s approach to determining the level of vesting for this award is set out in the ‘Remuneration in respect of performance periods ending in 2022’ section. The number of Prudential plc shares under award has been adjusted to take account of the Jackson demerger in line with the approach set out in the section on ‘Remuneration decisions taken in relation to the demerger’ in last year’s remuneration report. The actual value of vesting PLTIP awards, based on the share price on the date awards vest, will be shown in the 2023 report. Due to share price depreciation over the vesting period, the estimated value per share of the 2020 LTIP awards is 11.3 per cent lower than the value per share at grant. 2022 pension benefits include cash supplements for pension purposes and contributions into defined contribution schemes as outlined in the ‘pension benefit entitlement’ section. Total fixed remuneration includes salary, taxable benefits and pension benefits. Total variable remuneration includes total bonus and PLTIP awards vesting. Each remuneration element is rounded to the nearest $1,000 and totals are the sum of these rounded figures. Total 2022 remuneration has been converted to US dollars using the exchange rate of 0.8088 for GBP and 7.8305 for HKD. Exchange rate fluctuations will therefore impact the reported value. Total 2022 remuneration has been converted to GBP using the exchange rate of 0.8088 USD to 1 GBP.\n\n#",

CPL has more than doubled new business profit between 2017 and 2022, with new business profit for 2022 now 44 per cent higher than that of the pre-pandemic year 2019. We continue to outperform the market on the Chinese Mainland industry-wide measure of gross written premium basis by 5 times in 2022.\n\nApproaching stretch target level\n\nIndia: In ICICI Prudential, APE sales grew 4 per cent driven by strong growth in the protection and annuity business. This sales performance enabled ICICI Prudential to maintain its top three position in the private market with a market share of 6.3 per cent. Over the period, new business profit grew 20 per cent reflecting APE sales growth and a favourable product mix.\n\nThailand: We delivered higher-than-industry-average APE sales growth, both in the bancassurance channel and for the overall industry as a whole in 2022. We have double-digit APE sales growth for 3 consecutive years from 2020 to 2022, and now have an overall market share of 7 per cent, being 6th in the market. We have completed a smooth and planned CEO succession with the appointment of a local Thai CEO.\n\nIndonesia: We regained our leadership position in the Indonesian life market with 11 per cent market share by weighted new business premium in 2022.

This Policy has evolved from the current Policy which was approved at the AGM held on 14 May 2020 and has applied from that date.\n\nAs discussed in the Annual statement from the Chair of the Remuneration Committee (the ‘Committee’), the current Policy has operated as intended.

It also considered workforce remuneration and related policies in the businesses across the Group, including how the Company’s incentive arrangements are aligned with our footprint in Asia .

Where foregone awards were subject to performance conditions, performance conditions will normally be applied to awards replacing foregone long-term incentive awards; these will usually be the same as those applied to the long-term incentive awards made to Prudential Executive Directors in the year in which the forfeited award was made.

This scheme allows all eligible employees to save towards the exercise of options over Prudential plc shares with the option price set at the beginning of the savings period at a discount of up to 20 per cent of the market price.\n\nSince 2014, participants have been able to elect to enter into savings contracts of up to £500 per month for a period of three or five years. At the end of this term, participants may exercise their options within six months and purchase shares. If an option is not exercised within six months, participants are entitled to a refund of their cash savings plus interest if applicable under the rules. Shares are issued to satisfy those options which are exercised. No options may be granted under the schemes if the grant would cause the number of shares which have been issued, or which remain issuable pursuant to options granted in the preceding 10 years under the scheme and any other option schemes operated by the Company, or which have been issued under any other share incentive scheme of the Company, to exceed 10 per cent of the Company’s ordinary share capital at the proposed date of grant.\n\nDetails of Executive Directors’ rights under the SAYE scheme are set out in the ‘Outstanding share options’ table.\n\nShare Incentive Plan (SIP) UK-based Executive Directors are also eligible to participate in the Company’s Share Incentive Plan (SIP). Since April 2014, all UK-based employees have been able to purchase Prudential plc shares up to a value of £150 per month from their gross salary (partnership shares) through the SIP. For every four partnership shares bought, an additional matching share is awarded which is purchased by Prudential plc on the open market. Dividend shares accumulate while the employee participates in the plan. If the employee withdraws from the plan, or leaves the Group, matching shares may be forfeited.",

Upon the disposal of the entity, the related cumulative foreign exchange translation differences are recycled from other comprehensive income to the income statement as part of the gain or loss on disposal.\n\nThe general principle for converting foreign currency transactions to the functional currency of an entity is to translate at the functional currency spot rate prevailing at the date of the transactions. Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities are translated at the spot exchange rate for the functional currency at the reporting date. Changes resulting from the foreign exchange translations into the functional currency of the entity are recognised in the income statement.\n\nCertain notes to the consolidated financial statements present comparative information at constant exchange rates (CER), in addition to the reporting at actual exchange rates (AER) used throughout the consolidated financial statements. AER are actual historical exchange rates for the specific accounting year, being the average rates over the year for the income statement and the closing rates at the balance sheet date for the statement of financial position. CER results are calculated by translating prior year results using the current year foreign exchange rate, ie current year average rates for the income statement and current year closing rates for the statement of financial position.",

Financial investments measured at fair value are classified into a three-level hierarchy as described in note C2.1.\n\nIf the market for a financial investment of the Group is not active, the Group establishes fair value by using quotations from independent third parties, such as brokers or pricing services, or by using internally developed pricing models. Priority is given to publicly available prices from independent sources when available, but overall the source of pricing and/or the valuation technique is chosen with the objective of arriving at a fair value measurement which reflects the price at which an orderly transaction would take place between market participants on the measurement date. Changes in assumptions relating to these variables could positively or negatively impact the reported fair value of these financial investments. Details of the financial investments classified as ‘level 3’ to which valuation techniques are applied and the sensitivity of profit before tax to a change in the valuation of these items, are presented in note C2.2.",

For measurement purposes, contracts are grouped together into contracts of similar risk, profitability profile and issue year, with further divisions for contracts that are managed separately.\n\nThe establishment of CSM on the Group’s in-force business and transition approach Transition refers to the determination of the opening balance sheet for the first year of comparative information presented under IFRS 17 (ie at 1 January 2022). The future cash flows and risk adjustment are measured on a current basis in the same manner as they would be calculated for subsequent measurement. The key component of transition is therefore the determination of the CSM.\n\nThe standard requires IFRS 17 to be applied retrospectively (the ‘fully retrospective approach’) unless impracticable. If a fully retrospective\n\napproach is impracticable there is an option to choose either a modified retrospective approach or a fair value approach.

The future cash flows and risk adjustment are measured on a current basis in the same manner as they would be calculated for subsequent measurement. The key component of transition is therefore the determination of the CSM.\n\nThe standard requires IFRS 17 to be applied retrospectively (the ‘fully retrospective approach’) unless impracticable.

Short-term fluctuations also reflect losses on equities backing shareholder-backed business following market movements in 2022 (2021: equity gains) and the impact of refinements to the reserving basis in Hong Kong following the adoption of the Risk-Based Capital regime (as discussed further in note C3.2).\n\n(v)",

Of the $1.9 million one-off non-audit services fees associated with the demerger of the US operations and the public offering in Hong Kong in 2021, $0.1 million was for audit-related assurance and $0.1 million for other assurance services required by law and regulation.\n\n305\n\nB3 Tax charge\n\nPrudential is subject to tax in numerous jurisdictions and the calculation of the total tax charge inherently involves a degree of estimation and judgement. Current tax expense is charged or credited based upon amounts estimated to be payable or recoverable as a result of taxable amounts for the current year and adjustments made in relation to prior years. The positions taken in tax returns where applicable tax regulation is subject to interpretation are recognised in full in the determination of the tax charge in the consolidated financial statements if the Group considers that it is probable that the taxation authority will accept those positions. Otherwise, provisions are established based on the likely amount of the liability, or recovery, by providing for the single best estimate of the most likely outcome or the weighted average expected value where there are multiple outcomes.\n\nThe total tax charge includes tax expense attributable to both policyholders and shareholders. The tax expense attributable to policyholders comprises the tax on the income of the consolidated with-profits and unit-linked funds. In certain jurisdictions, life insurance companies are taxed on both their shareholders’ profits and on their policyholders’ insurance and investment returns on certain insurance and investment products. Although both types of tax are included in the total tax charge in the Group’s Consolidated income statement, they are presented separately in the Consolidated income statement to provide the most relevant information about tax that the Group pays on its profits.\n\nDeferred taxes are provided under the liability method for all relevant temporary differences. IAS 12 ‘Income Taxes’ does not require all\n\ntemporary differences to be provided for, in particular, the Group does not provide for deferred tax on undistributed earnings of subsidiaries where the Group is able to control the timing of the distribution and the temporary difference created is not expected to reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets are only recognised when it is more likely than not that future taxable profits will be available against which these losses can be utilised.\n\nDeferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability settled, based on tax\n\nrates (and laws) that have been enacted or are substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period.",

In certain jurisdictions, life insurance companies are taxed on both their shareholders’ profits and on their policyholders’ insurance and investment returns on certain insurance and investment products. Although both types of tax are included in the total tax charge in the Group’s Consolidated income statement, they are presented separately in the Consolidated income statement to provide the most relevant information about tax that the Group pays on its profits.\n\nDeferred taxes are provided under the liability method for all relevant temporary differences. IAS 12 ‘Income Taxes’ does not require all\n\ntemporary differences to be provided for, in particular, the Group does not provide for deferred tax on undistributed earnings of subsidiaries where the Group is able to control the timing of the distribution and the temporary difference created is not expected to reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets are only recognised when it is more likely than not that future taxable profits will be available against which these losses can be utilised.\n\nDeferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability settled, based on tax\n\nrates (and laws) that have been enacted or are substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period.",

If the value of all these level 3 financial instruments decreased by 10 per cent, the change in valuation would be $(11) million (31 December 2021: $(13) million), which would reduce shareholders’ equity by this amount before tax.

In light of this development and, given that the measurement technique set out within the local regulatory basis has been applied by PHKL to calculate IFRS liabilities, the Group has refined the reserving methodology of PHKL by reference to the method applied under the new HK RBC regime.\n\nUnder the basis previously applied, liabilities of non-participating business were generally determined on a net premium valuation basis to determine the future policyholder benefit provisions, subject to minimum floors. Using the principles underpinning the HK RBC regime, the IFRS reserving basis has been refined to one that is based on a gross premium valuation basis (including an allowance for the uncertainty of non- hedgeable risks), subject to minimum floors.

In light of this development and, given that the measurement technique set out within the local regulatory basis has been applied by PHKL to calculate IFRS liabilities, the Group has refined the reserving methodology of PHKL by reference to the method applied under the new HK RBC regime.\n\nUnder the basis previously applied, liabilities of non-participating business were generally determined on a net premium valuation basis to determine the future policyholder benefit provisions, subject to minimum floors. Using the principles underpinning the HK RBC regime, the IFRS reserving basis has been refined to one that is based on a gross premium valuation basis (including an allowance for the uncertainty of non- hedgeable risks), subject to minimum floors. Depending on the product, the minimum floor is set at the policyholder’s asset share or guaranteed cash surrender value or at a constraint that on day one no negative reserve exists at a product level. This new measurement technique better estimates the liability and brings the estimation basis for PHKL more in line with that used by the Group’s other insurance operations.

The market and insurance risks and also ESG-related risks, including how they affect Group’s operations and how these are managed are discussed in the Risk review report referred to above. The ESG-related risks discussed in the Risk review report include in particular the potential long-term impact of environmental risks associated with climate change (including physical and transition risks) on the Group’s investments and liabilities. The ESG Report included in this Annual Report sets out three commonly used scenarios of plausible global responses to climate change. Each scenario is translated into potential sensitivities to economic factors, using third party calibrated inputs, which have then been applied during the year to the Group’s starting assets and liabilities to quantify possible future impacts thereon. Though the Group remains exposed to financial impact from plausible global responses addressing climate change, the results for each scenario are not outside observed market volatility experienced and therefore do not indicate the need for explicit allowance for climate change within the current valuations. In addition, given the nature of the business, the impact of climate change does not directly alter the Group’s assumptions for claims and lapses for its insurance business based on the annual review of experience. If experience or exposure changes, for example due to a step change in long-term morbidity and/or mortality expectations in a particular region due to climate events, the financial impacts from climate-related risks on our insurance liabilities could be more significant and would be allowed for as part of the regular review.\n\nThe most significant market and credit risks that the IFRS shareholders’ profit or loss and shareholders’ equity for the Group’s life assurance business are sensitive to, are shown in the following tables. The distinction between direct and indirect exposure is not intended to indicate the relative size of the sensitivity. In addition, insurance businesses are sensitive to mortality and/or morbidity risk as well as persistency risk depending on the products sold.",

Each scenario is translated into potential sensitivities to economic factors, using third party calibrated inputs, which have then been applied during the year to the Group’s starting assets and liabilities to quantify possible future impacts thereon. Though the Group remains exposed to financial impact from plausible global responses addressing climate change, the results for each scenario are not outside observed market volatility experienced and therefore do not indicate the need for explicit allowance for climate change within the current valuations. In addition, given the nature of the business, the impact of climate change does not directly alter the Group’s assumptions for claims and lapses for its insurance business based on the annual review of experience. If experience or exposure changes, for example due to a step change in long-term morbidity and/or mortality expectations in a particular region due to climate events, the financial impacts from climate-related risks on our insurance liabilities could be more significant and would be allowed for as part of the regular review.\n\nThe most significant market and credit risks that the IFRS shareholders’ profit or loss and shareholders’ equity for the Group’s life assurance business are sensitive to, are shown in the following tables. The distinction between direct and indirect exposure is not intended to indicate the relative size of the sensitivity. In addition, insurance businesses are sensitive to mortality and/or morbidity risk as well as persistency risk depending on the products sold.",

This arises because the discount rate in some operations does not fluctuate in line with interest rate movements. Under a 0.5% decrease interest rate scenario although in the majority of operations asset gains exceed the increase in liabilities, there are a number of operations where the increase in liabilities dominates, driven by an increase in the value of policyholder guarantees, hence this results in an overall small negative impact of an instantaneous decrease of rates at 31 December 2022.\n\nMovements in equities backing with-profits and unit-linked business have been excluded from the equity and property sensitivities as they are generally matched by an equal movement in insurance liabilities (including unallocated surplus of with-profits funds).

At\n\n31 December 2022, deferred tax liabilities of $216 million (31 December 2021: $330 million) have not been recognised in respect of such withholding taxes as the Group is able to control the timing of the distributions and it is probable that the timing differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.\n\n334\n\nprudentialplc.com",

The main updates to the local regulation were to\n\nintroduce explicit tiering and admissibility rules on negative reserves in the capital resources and further updates to the risk calibrations used in calculating capital requirements.\n\nHong Kong In April 2022, Prudential Hong Kong Limited received approval from the Hong Kong IA to early adopt the new risk-based capital regime (HK RBC) effective from 1 January 2022. The HK RBC framework requires liabilities to be based on a gross premium valuation method using best estimate assumptions and capital requirements to be risk-based, resulting in the release of prudent regulatory margins previously included in liabilities and an increase in required capital.\n\nIndonesia Solvency capital is determined using a risk-based capital approach. The capital resources are based on assets that are marked-to-market, with policyholder liabilities based on a gross premium valuation method using best estimate assumptions with a suitable margin for prudence. Liabilities are zeroised at policy level (ie negative liabilities are not permitted at a policy level). For unit-linked policies, an unearned premium reserve is established.",

Overview of our audit continued\n\nThe impact of climate change on our audit\n\nIn planning our audit, we have considered the potential impact of climate change on the Group’s business and its financial statements.\n\nThe Group has set out its commitments to decarbonise its portfolio of assets held on behalf of its insurance companies with a new goal of becoming “net zero” by 2050. Further information is provided in the Group’s Environment, Social and Governance report.\n\nClimate change risk could have a significant impact on the Group’s business as the operations and strategy of the Group are adapted to address the potential financial and non-financial risks which could arise from both the physical and transition risks associated with climate change. Climate change initiatives and commitments could impact the financial statements of the Group in a variety of ways including in the determination of fair value for assets and potential for increased claims experience which could impact the valuation of liabilities. Greater narrative and disclosure of the impact of climate change risk is incorporated into the annual report.\n\nAs a part of our audit we have made enquiries of the directors and other management to understand the extent of the potential impact of climate change risk on the Group’s financial statements and the Group’s preparedness for this. We have performed a risk assessment of how the impact of the scenario analysis performed by the Group in respect of climate change may affect the financial statements and our audit, this involved a discussion with our own climate risk subject matter professionals to challenge our risk assessment.

Overview of our audit continued\n\nThe impact of climate change on our audit\n\nIn planning our audit, we have considered the potential impact of climate change on the Group’s business and its financial statements.\n\nThe Group has set out its commitments to decarbonise its portfolio of assets held on behalf of its insurance companies with a new goal of becoming “net zero” by 2050. Further information is provided in the Group’s Environment, Social and Governance report.\n\nClimate change risk could have a significant impact on the Group’s business as the operations and strategy of the Group are adapted to address the potential financial and non-financial risks which could arise from both the physical and transition risks associated with climate change. Climate change initiatives and commitments could impact the financial statements of the Group in a variety of ways including in the determination of fair value for assets and potential for increased claims experience which could impact the valuation of liabilities. Greater narrative and disclosure of the impact of climate change risk is incorporated into the annual report.\n\nAs a part of our audit we have made enquiries of the directors and other management to understand the extent of the potential impact of climate change risk on the Group’s financial statements and the Group’s preparedness for this. We have performed a risk assessment of how the impact of the scenario analysis performed by the Group in respect of climate change may affect the financial statements and our audit, this involved a discussion with our own climate risk subject matter professionals to challenge our risk assessment. There was no significant impact of this on our key audit matters.\n\nWe have assessed how the Group considers the impact of climate change risk on the valuation of the policyholder liabilities taking into account the nature of the insurance contracts that the Group enters into and the associated valuation methodology. This has not had a significant impact on the related key audit matter. We have also incorporated a consideration of the climate change impact on the audit of the valuation of certain level 2 and level 3 positions within the portfolio of financial investments held at fair value, taking into account the nature of the investments and the associated valuation approach.

Further judgement is required to assess whether the directors’ overall estimate, based on their judgement depending on the observability and significance of the inputs into the valuation and the consequent impact on the classification of those investments, falls within an acceptable range.\n\nFor a sample of unlisted debt securities we compared the price adopted to our independently derived price, using our valuation specialists. For a sample of unlisted funds, we agreed the valuations for the NAV funds to the most recent NAV statements. To assess reliability of these statements we compared to audited financial statements of the funds, where available, or performed a retrospective test over the NAV valuations for each fund to assess if the fund valuations reported in the audited financial statements in the prior year were materially consistent with the most recent NAV valuation statements available at the time.",

This is comprised of unlisted debt securities and unlisted funds that are valued by reference to their Net Asset Value (‘NAV funds’). For these positions a reliable third-party price was not readily available and therefore involved the application of expert judgement in the valuations adopted.\n\nMethodology choice We assessed the appropriateness of the valuation methodologies with reference to relevant accounting standards as well as industry practice.\n\nControl operation We tested the design, implementation and operating effectiveness of key controls over the valuation process, including the Group’s review and approval of the estimates and assumptions used for the valuation including key authorisation and data input controls.\n\nTests of detail For a sample of securities, we used our valuation specialists to assess the Group’s classification of assets within Level 2 or Level 3 by evaluating the observability of the inputs used in valuing these securities.\n\nAuditor judgement is required in determining the appropriate valuation methodology where external pricing sources are either not readily available or are unreliable. Further judgement is required to assess whether the directors’ overall estimate, based on their judgement depending on the observability and significance of the inputs into the valuation and the consequent impact on the classification of those investments, falls within an acceptable range.\n\nFor a sample of unlisted debt securities we compared the price adopted to our independently derived price, using our valuation specialists. For a sample of unlisted funds, we agreed the valuations for the NAV funds to the most recent NAV statements. To assess reliability of these statements we compared to audited financial statements of the funds, where available, or performed a retrospective test over the NAV valuations for each fund to assess if the fund valuations reported in the audited financial statements in the prior year were materially consistent with the most recent NAV valuation statements available at the time.",

This was determined with reference to a benchmark of IFRS shareholders’ equity.\n\nConsistent with FY21, we determined that IFRS shareholders’ equity remains the main benchmark for the Group as it represents the residual interest that can be ascribed to shareholders after policyholder assets and corresponding liabilities have been accounted for; we consider that this is the most appropriate measure for the size of the business and that it provides a stable measure year on year.\n\nOur Group materiality of $190m (FY21: $190m) was determined by applying a percentage to the IFRS Shareholders’ equity. When using a benchmark of net assets/equity to determine overall materiality, KPMG’s approach for listed entities considers a guideline range 0.5 - 2% of the measure. In setting overall Group materiality, we applied a percentage of 1.1% (FY21: 1.1%) to the benchmark.\n\nMateriality for the Parent Company financial statements as a whole was set at $45m (FY21: $53m), determined with reference to a benchmark of Parent Company net assets, of which it represents 0.3% (FY21: 0.4%).\n\n$140m (FY21: $140m)",

The fall in total eligible capital resources and tier 1 group capital are primarily driven by market movements over the year, driven largely by falling equity markets and increasing interest rates, and external dividends paid partially offset by the positive contribution from operating capital generation.\n\n> Total regulatory GPCR has decreased by $(2.9) billion to $17.7 billion at 31 December 2022 (31 December 2021: $20.6 billion) and the total regulatory GMCR has decreased by $(1.2) billion to $5.3 billion at 31 December 2022 (31 December 2021: $6.5 billion). The fall in GPCR and GMCR are primarily driven by market movements over the year and the release of capital as the policies mature or are surrendered, partially offset by an increase as a result of new business sold over the year.",

Although circa 6 per cent of the embedded value emerges after this date, analysis of cash flows emerging in the years shown is considered most meaningful. The modelled cash flows use the same methodology underpinning the Group’s embedded value reporting and so are subject to the same assumptions and sensitivities used to prepare our 2022 results.",

Separately, for IFRS financial results, adjusted operating profit also excludes amortisation of acquisition accounting adjustments arising on the purchase of business. For EEV basis results, operating profit also excludes the effect of changes in economic assumptions and the mark-to-market value movements on core structural borrowings for shareholder-financed operations.

Adjusted operating profit and EEV operating profit are determined on the basis of including longer-term investment returns, which are stated after excluding the effect of short-term fluctuations in investment returns on shareholder-backed business and gain or loss attaching to corporate transactions. Separately, for IFRS financial results, adjusted operating profit also excludes amortisation of acquisition accounting adjustments arising on the purchase of business. For EEV basis results, operating profit also excludes the effect of changes in economic assumptions and the mark-to-market value movements on core structural borrowings for shareholder-financed operations. Eastspring total funds under management or advice comprise funds from external parties, including funds managed on behalf of M&G plc, as well as funds managed or advised for the Group’s insurance operations. The Group shareholder GWS capital surplus (over GPCR) reflects the Insurance (Group Capital) Rules as set out in the GWS Framework which became effective for Prudential in May 2021.The 2021 comparative information has been re-resented to reflect the impact of HK RBC and C-ROSS II regimes which became effective in the first half of 2022 and after allowing for the impact of the $1.7 billion debt redemption in January 2022 to show total Group GWS capital surplus (over GPCR) on a more comparable basis. Prior to 2021, the Group adopted LCSM basis.\n\n425",

Uncertainty, fluctuations or negative trends in global and national macroeconomic conditions and investment climates could have a material adverse effect on Prudential’s business and profitability. Prudential operates in a macroeconomic and global financial market environment that has materially changed in recent periods. This presents significant uncertainties and potential challenges. For example, the rise in energy and commodity prices, exacerbated by the Russia-Ukraine conflict and global supply chain stresses, has contributed to the current inflationary environment. This has resulted in central banks, led by the US, rapidly tightening financial conditions with potential for further increases in interest rates in major global economies and the markets in which the Group operates, adversely impacting the valuation of fixed income assets and future profits due to the use of higher discount rates. In addition, the rising rates for developed economies have also led to weakened exchange rates of a number of emerging economies in which the Group operates, adversely impacting Prudential’s consolidated financial statements upon the translation of results into US dollars, the Group’s reporting currency. Other market uncertainties also include the impact of factors such as the nature and extent of central banks and governments actions in response to the inflationary environment, and the rapid relaxation of the Chinese Mainland’s zero tolerance Covid-19 policy as well as border reopening. These uncertainties may apply for a prolonged period of time. The transition to a lower carbon economy, the timing and speed of which is uncertain and will vary by country, may also result in greater uncertainty, fluctuations or negative trends in asset valuations and reduced liquidity, particularly for carbon intensive sectors, and will have a bearing on inflation levels. The uncertain macroeconomic and financial market environment may have a number of adverse impacts on the business, financial condition and results of the Group, including increased strategic, business, insurance, product and customer conduct risks. In general, upheavals in the financial markets may affect general levels of economic activity, employment and customer behaviour. As a result, insurers may experience an elevated incidence of claims, frauds, lapses, or surrenders of policies, and some policyholders may choose to defer or stop paying insurance premiums or reduce deposits into retirement plans.

        "raw_text": "Apart from IFRS 17, any other changes or modification of IFRS accounting policies may also require a change in the way in which future results will be determined and/or a retrospective adjustment of reported results to ensure consistency.\n\nThere is a risk that new regulations introduced may have a material adverse effect on the sales of the products by Prudential and increase Prudential’s exposure to legal risks. Any regulatory action arising out of the Group’s position as a product provider could have an adverse impact on the Group’s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects, or otherwise harm its reputation.\n\n441\n\n4.3 Litigation, disputes and regulatory investigations may adversely affect Prudential’s business, financial condition, cash flows, results of operations and prospects. Prudential is, and may in the future be, subject to legal actions, disputes and regulatory investigations in various contexts, including in the ordinary course of its insurance, investment management and other business operations. These legal actions, disputes and investigations may relate to aspects of Prudential’s businesses and operations that are specific to Prudential, or that are common to companies that operate in Prudential’s markets. Legal actions and disputes may arise under contracts, regulations or from a course of conduct taken by Prudential, including class action litigation. Although Prudential believes that it has adequately provided in all material respects for the costs of litigation and regulatory matters, no assurance can be provided that such provisions are sufficient. Given the large or indeterminate amounts of damages sometimes sought, other sanctions that might be imposed and the inherent unpredictability of litigation and disputes, it is possible that an adverse outcome could have an adverse effect on Prudential’s business, financial condition, cash flows, results of operations and prospects.\n\n4.4 Changes in tax legislation may result in adverse tax consequences for the Group’s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Tax rules, including those relating to the insurance industry, and their interpretation may change, possibly with retrospective effect in any of the jurisdictions in which Prudential operates. Significant tax disputes with tax authorities, and any change in the tax status of any member of the Group or in taxation legislation or its scope or interpretation could affect Prudential’s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.",

The project has two pillars. The first pillar is focused on the allocation of taxing rights between jurisdictions for in-scope multinational enterprises that sell cross- border goods and services into countries with little or no local physical presence. The second pillar is focused on developing a global minimum tax rate of 15 per cent applicable to in-scope multinational enterprises.\n\nOn 20 December 2021 the OECD published detailed model rules for the second pillar, with implementation of the rules initially envisaged by 2023. These rules will apply to Prudential when implemented into the national law of jurisdictions where it has entities within the scope of the rules. On 14 March 2022 the OECD issued detailed guidance to assist with interpreting the model rules. On 20 December 2022 the OECD issued additional documents including proposals for safe harbours and a consultation on the proposed information return. On 2 February 2023 the OECD also issued its first tranche of agreed administrative guidance which is intended to ensure that the model rules are implemented and applied in a co-ordinated manner. It is expected that a revised version of the guidance (which was issued in March 2022) will be released later this year. Furthermore, the OECD is expected to publish further agreed administrative guidance on an ongoing basis.\n\nOn 17 November 2022 the UK government confirmed its intention to implement rules into UK legislation for the second pillar through inclusion in the Spring Finance Bill 2023 with the rules applying to accounting periods beginning on or after 31 December 2023. On 23 December 2022, the parliament of the Republic of Korea approved the budget bill for 2023 which includes the enactment of rules for the second pillar. This enactment of the rules in the Republic of Korea is not, in isolation, expected to have any impact for Prudential.\n\nA number of jurisdictions in which Prudential has operations have indicated that consideration is being given to introducing a domestic minimum tax for in-scope multinationals alongside introducing the model rules. As Prudential operates in a number of jurisdictions where the effective tax rate can be less than 15 per cent, the implementation of the model rules and/or equivalent domestic minimum tax rules may have an adverse impact on the Group. Until all expected OECD documents are published and details of implementing domestic legislation in relevant jurisdictions are available, the full extent of the long-term impact on Prudential’s business, tax liabilities and profits remain uncertain.",

In addition, RBC is not designed to be used as a stand-alone tool in determining financial solvency of an insurance company; rather it is one of the tools that give regulators legal authority to take control of an insurance company.\n\nO Operational borrowings Borrowings which arise in the normal course of the business, including all lease liabilities under IFRS 16.\n\nMorbidity rate Rate of sickness, varying by such parameters as age, gender and health, used in pricing and computing liabilities for future policyholders of health products, which contain morbidity risks.",
